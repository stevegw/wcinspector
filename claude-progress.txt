# WCInspector Development Progress

## Session 1 - January 25, 2025

### What was accomplished:
- Set up Python virtual environment in `venv/` directory
- Installed all required dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, ChromaDB, BeautifulSoup4, etc.)
- Started the FastAPI backend server on port 8000
- Verified Feature #1: "App loads without errors"

### Feature #1 Verification Details:
- Navigated to http://localhost:8000
- Page loads successfully with title "Windchill Investigator"
- No JavaScript console errors
- No warnings in console
- All main UI elements are visible:
  - Header with app title and branding
  - History sidebar with empty state
  - Question input textbox with placeholder
  - Send button
  - 5 sample/example questions
  - Welcome message
  - Knowledge base stats (4,765 chunks indexed, llama3:8b model)
- Network requests successful (API stats endpoint returns 200 OK)
- Screenshot saved to .playwright-mcp/feature1_initial_load.png

### Current Status:
- Features passing: 1/64 (1.56%)
- Features in progress: 1 (Feature #2 being worked on by another agent)

### Notes:
- The application appears to be more developed than the initial skeleton files suggested
- A different frontend/UI has been implemented (different from the index.html in frontend/ folder)
- The actual app is served from a static folder with a different structure
- The backend health endpoint works and reports Ollama connection with llama3:8b model
- Knowledge base already has 4,765 chunks indexed

### Next Steps:
- Continue with remaining features
- Features should be verified one at a time through the browser
